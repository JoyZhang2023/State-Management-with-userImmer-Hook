# State Management with userImmer Hook
 AD 320 Assginment

## Objective
Learn to manage complex React state using the useImmer hook from the Immer library, facilitating easier and more readable state updates for nested structures.

## a brief description of your experience using useImmer and how it compares to using useState for managing complex state
useImmer is more intuitive than useState becuase the syntax is more like direct mutation while the state in useState can not be direct mutated.
